This is a Library built in Go. We use simple data structures of Go such as structs maps and slices to represent a simple Library System like a small database. We also use methods to add functionality to the library 
such as register a member total count of the books total count of the available books and calculate our discount policy and the cost of the user's choices. 
It is a a user-console interractive app in which we read the user's inputs with the Scan method and we save the values in variables.
